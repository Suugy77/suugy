## 👨‍💻 Description

This project is a fully interactive **Sudoku game** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** as part of my CS50x final project.

The game features:
- ✅ A dynamic 9x9 Sudoku grid
- 🧠 Random valid puzzle generation using a backtracking algorithm
- 🎛️ Buttons for "New Game", "Check", "Exit", and "Toggle Theme"
- ⏱️ A built-in timer
- 🌙 Light/Dark mode toggle
- 🔊 Sound effects for clicks and errors
- 🎨 Clean and responsive UI

---

## 🚀 How It Works

- On load or clicking "New Game", a valid Sudoku puzzle is generated with 50–60 missing cells.
- JavaScript dynamically renders the grid and controls all interactions.
- The timer starts and updates every second using `setInterval`.
- Theme toggle uses a CSS `.dark-mode` class to switch themes.
- Input triggers a soft click sound; "Check" triggers an error sound (as a placeholder for future validation).

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **HTML5** – Structure and elements
- **CSS3** – Styling, dark mode, responsive design
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – DOM manipulation, grid generation, event handling, timer, sound effects
- **Backtracking algorithm** – To ensure puzzle validity

## 🧠 What I Learned

While building this project, I deepened my understanding of:
- Recursive algorithms (Sudoku generation)
- DOM creation and manipulation
- CSS Grid and Flexbox layout systems
- Event-driven programming in JavaScript
- UI/UX design principles
- Audio integration and timer logic

## 📈 Future Plans

- Implement full Sudoku solution validation
- Add difficulty levels (Easy/Medium/Hard)
- Create a hint system
- Save progress via `localStorage`
- Mobile-first responsive design improvements
